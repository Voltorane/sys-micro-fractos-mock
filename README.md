# sys-micro-fractos-mock
---
## Overview
---
A FractOS mock imitates a distributed system for decentralized appliactions following the proposed by FractOS design. 
Our mock system nodes are an abstraction of hardware, e.g., a storage node represents an SSD, and computational nodes act as CPU/GPU.
We use ZooKeeper to maintain large set of hosts and coordinate among them.

[Installation & setup guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
* Install dependencies.
  ```
  pip3 install ...
  ```
* Clone repository.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Voltorane/sys-micro-fractos-mock.git
  ```
* Do something

## Configuration

## Demo
---
Here we will walk you through the workflow of this program, mainly how to run a convolutional neural network application in the proposed system.
## Research paper
